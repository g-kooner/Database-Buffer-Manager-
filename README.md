# CMPUT391_Buffer_Manager_Skeleton

This contains a bare-bones heap.c and heap.h as well as the test file.

## Notes

- buffer.c is unchangeed from the B+ tree version, this means the files do not close on bufferShutDownDb().

Files that are not expected to change and should work with the completed code: 
 - Makefile 
 - include/buffer.h 
 - include/file.h
 - src/file.c
 - 

Files that are expected to change once the code is completed:
 - include/heap.h
 - src/buffer.c
 - src/heap.c
 - src/heapTest.c 
 - src/heapTest.h    may or may not change

**working-branch has the code in it**
